##  🔧 Environment Set Up

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the UnifiedReward folder:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CodeGoat24/UnifiedReward.git
cd UnifiedReward
```

## 💻 Training UnifiedReward

### 1. Training based on Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct (Recommended)
We use [LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory) to train the SFT model.

🚨Unstable behaviors in `dataset.map()` function:
When trying to train UnifiedReward on mixed image and video datasets, `TypeError: Couldn't cast array of type list<item: string> to null` may occur in the `dataset.map()` function. This is a known bug, and you can refer to https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/issues/5613 and https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/issues/7222.

There are 3 ways to avoid this:

1. Tokenize video datasets and image datasets separately and cache them.
2. Set preprocessing batch to 1.
3. Transform a single video into multiple images.

**Full-Tuning**

1. Clone the [LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory) repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory.git
cd LLaMA-Factory
pip install -e ".[torch,metrics]"
```

2. Data Preprocessing.

```bash
python dataset/preprocess.py
```

Then follow LLaMA-Factory's README and to prepare our released [datasets](https://huggingface.co/collections/CodeGoat24/unifiedreward-training-data-67c300d4fd5eff00fa7f1ede). You can refer to the example [dataset_info.json](https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/UnifiedReward/blob/main/README.md).

3. Run the following command to train the Full-Tuning SFT model.

```bash
llamafactory-cli train examples/train_full/qwen2_5vl_full_sft.yaml
```

**LoRA**

1. Same preparation in Full-Tuning.

2. Run the following command to train the LoRA SFT model.

```bash
llamafactory-cli train lora/qwen2_5vl_lora_sft.yaml
```

3. Merge trained LoRA adapter to main model.

```bash
llamafactory-cli export lora/qwen2_5vl_lora_sft_merge.yaml
```

We provide evaluation code for [GenAI-Bench-Video](https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/GenAI-Bench), [GenAI-Bench-Image](https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/GenAI-Bench), [VideoGen-RewardBench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/KwaiVGI/VideoGen-RewardBench) and [VL-RewardBench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MMInstruction/VL-RewardBench) benchmarks.

### Video Understanding
We provide evaluation code for [MSRVTT](https://github.com/xudejing/video-question-answering), [MSVD](https://github.com/xudejing/video-question-answering), and [TGIF](https://github.com/YunseokJANG/tgif-qa) benchmarks while using the [VLMEvalKit](https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit) toolkit for evaluating LongVideoBench, MLVU, and Video-MME benchmarks with 64 input frames.

### Image Understanding
We use [LMMs-Eval](https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval) toolkit to evaluate LLaVABench, WildVision, LLaVABench-Wilder, LiveBench, and MMHal benchmarks.

### Image Generation
We utilize the image reward model,
i.e., [PickScore](https://github.com/yuvalkirstain/PickScore), [HPS](https://github.com/tgxs002/HPSv2) and [ImageReward](https://github.com/THUDM/ImageReward) for
quality assessment. 

### Video Generation
[VBench](https://github.com/Vchitect/VBench) is used for video generation assessment.

## 🤗 Acknowledgments
In this work, reward model and image/video understanding DPO code is based on [LLaVA-Next](https://github.com/LLaVA-VL/LLaVA-NeXT), while image and video generation DPO is based on [DiffusionDPO](https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/DiffusionDPO) and [VideoDPO](https://github.com/CIntellifusion/VideoDPO). 

We also utilize [LMMs-Eval](https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval) and [VLMEvalKit](https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit) toolkits for evaluation.

Thanks to all the contributors!
